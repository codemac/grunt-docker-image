grunt-docker-image
==================

Builds a simple docker image with a pinned version of grunt in it.

(to update this image on dockerhub:

1. register an account at https://hub.docker.com/ and get someone who already has one to add you to the "igneoussystems" organization.
2. register a "Trusted Build" on the docker hub

The build is executed by docker on their machines whenever you push to the repo.)
